# Mysensors Heater module
This Arduino nano module is responsible for controlling the heating at home.
It monitors the fuel tank level via an ultrasonic range meter 
as well as the outdoor temperature. It controls the
heating via a relay.

It communicates securely(AES ciphering + signed messages) with a MySensors MQTT
gateway running on a Arduino Uno
